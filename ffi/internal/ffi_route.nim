## Picks the FFI path of a proc from the shape of its signature.
##
## `{.ffi.}`, `{.ffiStatic.}`, `{.ffiExport.}`, `{.ffiDtor.}` and `{.ffiEvent.}`
## own five disjoint shapes, so one router serves all five. Each shape that the
## router claims fails to compile under any other pragma today, so the router
## only turns a compile error into the meaning the writer intended.
##
## `{.ffiCtor.}` stays explicit, because its shape is not free. A ctor differs
## from a static call by one token: the type inside `Result`. A static call that
## returns the library type builds today and exports a working C symbol. A
## router would silently give it the ctor ABI instead.
